# Pair Programming Lessons Guide/Index

The main reason for this repo to exist is create an index with **topics**, **exercises** and **examples** to be used as guide and reference for people who wants to start learning programming for the freecodecamp venezuela community.

We will also try to describe ideas, tools and software to make this lessons **accessible** and **achievable** for all members, taking into a count that some members do not have the best hardware, internet connection or stable electric supply.

It is well known that there are not a real path to learn programming but this guide/index aims to cover simple topics and encourage people to learn with others solving simple exercises doing pair programming or taking a part of their time learning by themselves.

## How to participate in pair programming lessons?

We try to schedule a pair programming exercise every week, free to join to all the participants in our Telegram group:
