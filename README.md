# Pair Programming Lessons Guide/Index

The main reason for this repo to exist is create an index with **topics**, **exercises** and **examples** to be used as guide and reference for people who wants to start learning programming or these whom may want to learn new things or refresh some knowledge for the freecodecamp venezuelan community.

We will also try to describe ideas, tools and software to make this lessons **accessible** and **achievable** for all members, taking into account that some members do not have the best hardware, internet connection or stable electric supply.

It is well known that there are not a real path to learn programming but this guide/index aims to cover simple topics and encourage people to learn with others solving simple exercises doing pair programming or taking a part of their time learning by themselves.

## How to participate in pair programming lessons

We will try to schedule a pair programming exercise every week, free to join to all the participants in our Telegram group:

    └── 01-example-topic
        ├── README.md
        ├── examples
        │   ├── README.md
        │   ├── example-one
        │   └── example-two
        └── exercises
            ├── README.md
            ├── exercise-one
            └── exercise-two
```

* **Lessons**: Is the root directory for all the topics.

* **Topics**: Includes a set of separate folders with the topics available to learn, and every topic folder includes inside a readme explaining the topic, *examples* and *exercises* folder with their instructions.

* **exercises**:: Inside this folder you will find a *README.md* with exercises index and what every exercise teach or achieve. Also exercises files.

### Ideas in develop

1. Create a repository
2. List possible topics
3. Create a strong repo structure
4. create collaboration rules
5. create a collab.templates
6. create pre commit hooks
7. create pull request template
8. Write "How to collaborate" section
9. Find a pseudo code language to write examples
10. Find more tools and add links in root readme

## How to collaborate
